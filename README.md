# cl-binary-store

A fast and reasonably customizable serializer/deserializer of Common Lisp objects to/from a binary format.  Equality of objects, circular references, and the full Common Lisp type system are supported.

> :warning: Note that this is not a serializer/deserializer for communication with other types of systems *yet*.  If you want that maybe use JSON or if you want a binary format maybe [cl-messagepack](https://github.com/mbrezu/cl-messagepack).

Currently this is sbcl specific, but I'd like to fix this up to work on other implementations, but it isn't top of mind.

This project works, has some test coverage, but is not finished yet.  I expect it to be polished and 1.0 released mid-January 2025.

> :warning: This is a work in progress, do not rely on it yet!

## Status

I have not cut a first release tag even though the system works well currently because I'd like to put in the pluggable version coding schemes first to always keep backwards compatibility with first release

## Focus
- Speed
- Compact output
- Data that has multiple and circular references within it
  - This dominates serialization time (but you can disable this feature to get crazy speeds)
  - Complex list circularity and references (other than to the head of lists, separately disableable as well)
- Versioned output
- Extensibility for user data types
- Should work out of the box without any effort with an easy programmer / user interface
- Stable API and no breaking changes (this is a standard Common Lisp goal)

## In progress / planned soon
- [ ] Pluggable versioned coding schemes:
  - [ ] optimized for highly referential data (tag bits mainly used for references instead of 8 bit tag codes)
  - [ ] optimized for non-referential data (tag bits used for immediate small numbers, small vectors / lists, for example)
  - [ ] messagepack (for example)
- [ ] Support for other Common Lisps aside from sbcl
  - [ ] At least basic slow support
  - [ ] Optimized support
- [ ] Further discoveries from real world use cases (that is, my use case)
  - [ ] Add restarts to handle missing packages / moved symboles during restore (create-package / rehome / discard)
  - [ ] Reference-id allocation by use amount
  - [ ] Build compacted hash tables after the reference counting
- [ ] Parallel restore?  I've given up on parallel store phase.
- [ ] Faster UTF-8 encoding / decoding (currently doing extra copy using sb-ext string-to-octets / octets-to-string)
- [ ] Always use references for symbols even when *track-references* nil.

## General features

All number types are supported, with the addition of specialized compact and fast writers for ub8, ub16, ub32, ub64, sb8, sb16, sb32, fixnum, single-float, double-float, (complex double-float), and (complex single-float).

All array types are supported, with the addition of specialized compact and very fast writers / readers for vectors and arrays of simple-bit-vectors, simple-base-string, single-floats, double-floats, fixnums, sb8, sb16, sb32, sb64, ub2, ub4, ub7, ub8, ub15, ub16, ub31, ub32, ub62, and ub64 (all these being supported by SBCL).

structure-objects and standard-objects have good default serialize/deserializers, and also conditions.

symbols, hash-tables, and pathnames are supported.

Multiply referenced objects are stored as references so equality is preserved across serialization / deserialization and circularity is supported.  If you disable reference tracking serialization is quite fast.

Large simple-arrays have dedicated (at least on sbcl) serializers / deserializers which should be close to disk/network/memory bandwidth limited.

Support for writing and reading from files, vectors, streams, and raw memory without having to jump through hoops.

A sketch of a versioning scheme is implemented.

## User interface
### (store place &rest data)

**place** can be string or pathname referring to a file, or a stream, or a vector, or NIL (in which case you will be returned a vector of data).

### (restore place)

**place** can be a string or pathname referring to a file, or a stream, or a vector.  For restoring to a system-area-pointer use restore-from-sap as you have to note how much data is available (good for mmap'ed files and large arrays).

### (store-to-sap sap size &rest data)
### (restore-from-sap sap size)
 If you have an mmap'ed file or a raw system-area-pointer, you can store to it and restore from it.

 For storing to one, you don't need to know the size in advance as we throw a restartable error allow you to allocate more system memory and continue on.  See tests/cl-binary-store-tests.lisp test-sap-write/read for a silly example of how to use this.  Nominally you'll be updating mmap regions of files or something.

## Examples
git clone the repo into your local quicklisp directory (usually ~/quicklisp/local-packages)

    CL-USER> (quicklisp:quickload "cl-binary-store")
    CL-USER> (in-package :cl-binary-store-user) ;  or (use-package :cl-binary-store-user)
    CL-BINARY-STORE-USER> (store nil (list "abcd" 1234))
    #(4 39 0 4 97 98 99 100 4 1 210 4 5)
    ;; 4 = cons, 39 = simple-string, 0 4 = length 4, 97 98 99 100 = abcd, 4 = cons
    ;; 1 210 4 = 16 bit integer 1234, 5 = nil
    
    CL-BINARY-STORE-USER> (restore (store nil (list "abcd" 1234)))
    ("abcd" 1234)

    CL-BINARY-STORE-USER> (store "blarg.bin" 'hi)
    "blarg.bin"
    CL-BINARY-STORE-USER> (restore "blarg.bin")
    HI
    CL-BINARY-STORE-USER> (store nil (make-string 1 :initial-element #\U+03b1))
    #(39 0 2 206 177) ;; 4 bytes, 39 = utf-8 string, 0 2 is encoded length = 2, 206 117 = Î±

    CL-BINARY-STORE-USER> (let* ((*print-circle* t)
                                 (v (make-array 1)))
                             (setf (svref v 0) v)
                             (store "blarg.bin" 'a 'b 'c v)
                             (format nil "~A" (multiple-value-list (restore "blarg.bin"))))
    "(A B C #1=#(#1#))"

To run tests you want to do

    CL-USER> (quicklisp:quickload "cl-store-binary-tests")
    CL-USER> (parachute:test 'cl-store-binary-tests)

The package :cl-binary-store-user exports all the user facing interfaces above.  The package :cl-binary-store exports all the symbols needed to add your own extensions.

### Configurable options
#### \*track-references\* default: T

Let this to NIL around your calls to store / restore if you have simple data with no references between them at all (so lists of data, no circularity, no repeated objects).  This then goes very fast (>500MB/sec / > 500 Mobjects/second for lists of numbers; > 5000 MB/sec for big simple arrays chunks).

#### \*support-shared-list-structures\* default: T

Let this to NIL if you have no list circularity (when it is NIL basic circular lists are supported as the first CONS we see in a list is recorded as a reference, so almost all data will work fine with this NIL; NIL makes this package behave like cl-store which will die / explode if given any complex circularity in a list).  Setting this to NIL is a significant performance improvement if you have list heavy data.

#### \*store-class-slots\* default: NIL

Standard object :class allocated slots will be stored if this is T.

#### \*write-magic-number\* default: NIL

If T we will write out a magic number and the \*write-version\* to the output, which will then be validated against \*supported-versions\* when read back in.

#### \*write-end-marker*\* default: NIL

If T we will write an end marker at the end of every call to STORE.  This helps for use when sending data across the network or reading from raw memory to avoid tracking lengths around.  It also means you can write multiple chunks of objects to a stream and have restore-objects return between each chunk.

## Why?

I've been using [cl-store](https://cl-store.common-lisp.dev/) forever and it works well and meets most needs once you tweak how it serializes a bunch of things for speed.  I am usually serializing / deserializing > 1GB of data and in the end all the tweaks I've done don't make it fast enough.  The original cl-store hits about 1-2MB/sec for store and restore on the data set I use which just is too slow. It also doesn't support complex list circularity in a reasonable way (the correct-list-store you can turn on blows the stack).

- It uses read-byte / write-byte to emit data which is OK-ish as long as you are using file streams in sbcl, but once you plug in a generic stream it crawls.
- The file format uses implicit referencing which makes it hard to deserialize quickly as each object must be tracked.  There was no easy way to to turn on and off what objects we should track references for (and it must match during store and restore).  It also tracks references for single floats which triggers a severe performance issue, at least on sbcl, related to eql hash tables which I have not tracked down..

I have also used [hyperluminal-mem](https://github.com/cosmos72/hyperluminal-mem), which is really fast if you meet the restrictions it has.  It does not support delayed object construction or references really, nor a nice default for structures and classes (though you can extend it with manual referencing on a per type basis and with serializers for each structure or class you want).

## What is different here?

### Explicit reference scheme

To make deserialization fast, we break the symmetry of store and restore by not using an implicit referencing scheme.  We add a reference counting pass across the input data where we find out what objects are multiply referenced.  Then on the actual write pass we write the references out on first use.  This speeds up restoration by about 10x.  Serialization with referencing is hash-table table lookup/update dominated.

With explicit referencing we can do parallelization during restore, though I haven't implemented it because it's already reasonably fast (it averages 20MB/sec on my data set)... see TODO.

### Performance during serialization

Performance during serialization is dominated by the reference hash table building and use.  This is quite hard to improve as the hash table is an eq table.  To enable parallelization on the serialization side would require hacking the internals of the system.

If your data does not contain multiple references or repeated objects (in particular, repeated symbols will be stored repeatedly!), then you can let \*track-references\* to NIL and you can hit hundreds of MB/sec depending on your data (unicode strings are currently a bit slow as we
are not using a fast utf-8 encoder) and 500M cons+integer objects per second.  It's about 10-30x faster than cl-store in this mode.  This package is between 3x faster and 3x slower than hyperluminal-mem depending on data patterns both on store and restore.  If you are storing simple arrays / matrices, you want to use cl-binary-store.

## Adding extensions

This is how it is currently done, which is janky --- pluggable coding schemes dispatched by magic-number / version are coming soon.

The current backend stores each object with a 8-bit type tag (with some reserved bits very soon).  You can define new type tags and write specialized storage and restore methods.  See codes.lisp for examples.  If you do this, you probably want to change the \*write-version\* and \*supported-versions\*.  To rebuild the dispatch mechanism if you have defined new defstore and defrestore things, you want to either load src/rebuild-dispatch.lisp, or call (rebuild-dispatch).  At that point all your object types have to be real, so typically this is done in a second file that is loaded after the first (see example-extension-2.lisp which both defines new dispatch mechanisms and calls (rebuild-dispatch)).

For serializing objects, the default behavior is probably good enough for 95% of users.  We provide a simple extension point with a generic function serializable-slot-info which you can change the behavior of, for example to enable calling initialize-instance instead of allocate-instance, or to not save certain slots or transform them before saving.  See comments in [objects.lisp](src/objects.lisp) and the example extension [example-extension.lisp](src/example-extension.lisp) for an example.

Further there is an extension point in [actions.lisp](src/actions.lisp), which are things that can be stored during store and can do things during restore --- this is how the versioning check is implemented (src/magic-numbers.lisp), how we hint to the reference vector size during restore, and how we write an end marker.

If that is not enough, I suggest adding a new store / restore method on your object type or class.

See the file src/example-extension.lisp and src/example-extension-2.lisp for examples of both these methods:

    CL-USER> (quicklisp:quickload "example-extension")
    CL-USER> (example-extension:test-serializable-slot-info)
    Success!
    CL-USER> (example-extension:test-special-serializer/deserializer)
    12345
    "Hi, I decided to write this instead of a 'something-else"
    "But actually, it told me to tell you:"
    "Hi"

## Compressed output

I suggest just piping the output through gzip.  Otherwise you can use [deoxybyte-gzip](https://github.com/keithj/deoxybyte-gzip) but warning it has a small bug in read-sequence, so use the version [here](https://github.com/ajberkley/deoxybyte-gzip).

## Benchmarking

To make something fast you have to measure it!  In src/benchmarks.lisp you'll see comparisons between CL-STORE, HYPERLUMINAL-MEM, and this package.  For example:

### A long list of very small integers
    ;; HYPERLUMINAL-MEM
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 8.00 MB
    ;;  HLMEM WRITE: 2.32 ms at 3448 MB/sec
    ;;  HLMEM READ : 5.04 ms at 1587 MB/sec
    ;; CL-BINARY-STORE
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 3.00 MB
    ;;  CL-BINARY-STORE WRITE: 3.60 ms at 833 MB/sec ;; (/ 2e6 3.6e-3) = 550Mobjs/second
    ;;  CL-BINARY-STORE READ : 8.20 ms at 366 MB/sec
    ;; CL-STORE
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 5.00MB
    ;;  CL-STORE WRITE: 59.20 ms at 84 MB/sec
    ;;  CL-STORE READ : 50.40 ms at 99 MB/sec
    (defun long-list-of-small-integers (&optional (n 1000000))
      (make-list n :initial-element (random 256)))

This is the most synthetic of all the tests.  It runs cl-binary-store without reference tracking which matches the behavior of cl-store and hyperluminal-mem for this single list case.  First thing to note is that the output file is small, because very small integers get written at 2 bytes per, one for a tag and one for the value.  For numbers less than 64-bit represented, we special case 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, fixnum.  Note that MB/sec isn't a great benchmark when output sizes vary a lot.  I note the above Mobjs/second instead, which is pretty incredible when you think about it --- I mean this is a super synthetic benchmark but we are doing type dispatching nice and quick here (OK, conses and fixnums are immediate objects, so type dispatch is crazy fast and they are at the front of the dispatch table --- see type-discrimination.md for some poking at this stuff).

### A long list of fixnums

The next one is cool because you can see the neat way hyperluminal-mem does tagging, a lot like the underlying sbcl implementation.  It's cool and makes things go very very fast in some cases.  Here you can see the wild difference between cl-store and this package.

    ;; HYPERLUMINAL-MEM
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 8.00 MB ;; bit tagging, not byte tagging
    ;;  HLMEM WRITE: 2.24 ms at 3571 MB/sec
    ;;  HLMEM READ : 5.04 ms at 1587 MB/sec
    ;; CL-BINARY-STORE
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 10.00 MB
    ;;  CL-BINARY-STORE WRITE: 3.84 ms at 2604 MB/sec
    ;;  CL-BINARY-STORE READ : 9.48 ms at 1055 MB/sec
    ;; CL-STORE
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 38.00MB
    ;;  CL-STORE WRITE: 422.39 ms at 90 MB/sec
    ;;  CL-STORE READ : 293.20 ms at 130 MB/sec
    (defun long-list-of-random-fixnums (&optional (n 1000000))
      (make-list n :initial-element (random (- (expt 2 61) (expt 2 60)))))

### Keywords!

While we are talking about synthetic things, how about a bunch of random keywords, cause who doesn't like randomly filling their heap with stuff.  Here we have reference tracking on all three systems (symbols is the only case where hyperluminal-mem does this).

    ;; With reference tracking on everyone
    ;; HYPERLUMINAL-MEM
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 3.20 MB
    ;;  HLMEM WRITE: 18.52 ms at 173 MB/sec
    ;;  HLMEM READ : 33.32 ms at 96 MB/sec
    ;; CL-BINARY-STORE
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 1.15 MB
    ;;  CL-BINARY-STORE WRITE: 28.56 ms at 40 MB/sec
    ;;  CL-BINARY-STORE READ : 29.36 ms at 39 MB/sec
    ;; CL-STORE
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 1.24MB
    ;;  CL-STORE WRITE: 52.80 ms at 24 MB/sec
    ;;  CL-STORE READ : 63.60 ms at 20 MB/sec
    (defun lots-of-keywords ()
      (loop for i fixnum from 0 below 100000
    	collect (intern (format nil "~A" (random 250000)) 'keyword)))

Here we are eq hash table dominated... not much to do about it right now.

### structure-objects

I didn't check hyperluminal-mem on this because you have to write a couple lines of code to make it work for user structs.

    ;; hyperluminal mem needs an extension for this so skipping it for now
    ;; CL-BINARY-STORE
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 1.79 MB
    ;;  CL-BINARY-STORE WRITE: 49.00 ms at 37 MB/sec
    ;;  CL-BINARY-STORE READ : 9.24 ms at 194 MB/sec
    ;; CL-STORE
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 6.69MB
    ;;  CL-STORE WRITE: 171.20 ms at 39 MB/sec
    ;;  CL-STORE READ : 182.40 ms at 37 MB/sec
    (defun lots-of-structure-objects ()
      (loop for i below 100000
            collect (make-blarg :a (random 1d0) :b (format nil "~A" (random 100)))))

### UTF-8 encoded strings

So hyperluminal-mem and cl-store output the raw 32-bit code points, whereas this package utf-8 encodes/decodes them.  I just happen to have a lot of (simple-array character (*)) in the data set that I use that are really just simple-base-strings... so a feature for me. It does increase the cons'ing during store restore as I have to copy the strings during encode / decode currently.

    ;; HYPERLUMINAL-MEM
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 2.40 MB
    ;;  HLMEM WRITE: 4.52 ms at 531 MB/sec
    ;;  HLMEM READ : 3.12 ms at 769 MB/sec
    ;; CL-BINARY-STORE
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 1.19 MB
    ;;  CL-BINARY-STORE WRITE: 4.04 ms at 294 MB/sec
    ;;  CL-BINARY-STORE READ : 8.68 ms at 137 MB/sec
    ;; CL-STORE
    ;;  OUTPUT SIZE: 2.08MB
    ;;  CL-STORE WRITE: 23.20 ms at 90 MB/sec
    ;;  CL-STORE READ : 11.60 ms at 179 MB/sec
    (defun simple-strings ()
      (loop for i below 100000
            collect (format nil "~A~A" (random 1000000) #\U+03b1)))

### Maybe more real world like?

Heh, not a chance.  This is still synthetic but I wanted to stress the dispatch mechanism a little bit. It is funny here if you put in random single floats cl-store doesn't finish for ages... it's something bad in sbcl eql hash tables but I haven't tracked it down yet.  Anyhow the first set of numbers are without reference tracking, so eql'ity is violated (that is they are all storing multiple copies of the strings --- do not worry, this is not the default settings of my package!).  Anyhow, still moving at a rapid clip, beating hyperluminal-mem which is nice.  Of course the real world use is the second set of numbers below "and using referencing" comment, where you see the explicit referencing scheme speeding up restore quite a lot.
