# Serialization speed

So, this whole thing works reasonably well for the use case I have and
deserialization of complex objects is blazingly fast.  But
serialization in the case of non-multiply referenced data (and no
circularity) is still about 3x slower than hyperluminal-mem.  So I did
a bit of benchmarking and found that about 30% of my time is spent in
type dispatch (this is for a very synthetic example of a list of a
million small numbers).  My dispatch mechanism is just a flat
etypecase grouped into disjoint types and sorted by subtype.  So, for
example, I allow dispatch to different functions for an (unsigned-byte
8) and a fixnum, or for a (simple-array double-float (*)) versus just
a simple-vector.  Nominally I'd expect the CLOS infrastructure for
dispatch to be relatively fast, but you cannot do easy top level
specialization for things like (simple-array (signed-byte 8) (4)), for
example, which in some cases it makes sense to do (for what I care
about, maybe not for the rest of the world!)

So, you'll find in the file src/type-discrimation.lisp my very crude
cut at determining how fast you can generate code use a tree of
discriminators (don't judge the code please, I wrote it as fast as
possible because I wanted to see the results).  First, I cut my type
space automatically into disjoint subsets (either fully or with some
hinting as to a good order to do the top level discrimination) and
then I compile discriminators, like I'd expect the compiler to do in a
nested typecase scenario.  At each node in the tree, I know what the
object under test's super-type is (even if just T) and what I have
learned so far about what the object is not.  I do a rough count of
the number of instructions, function-calls, and compares done to get
to a decision.  So, for an example, here I choose a not so random
top-level ordering (the first few are immediate/unboxed objects in a
sense, and so should be easy to discriminate) (you can also run this
with just '(t) as a singular tree root, but it's far from optimal!).

  (simulate-discriminators *many-types*
     '(cons fixnum null (eql t) single-float
       array number structure-object standard-object t))

Here's my ascii art representation of the resulting tree and some annotations run
on sbcl 2.4.4.

    CONS 3 compares, 13 instructions, and 0 function-calls
    FIXNUM 4 compares, 22 instructions, and 0 function-calls
     (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32) 5 compares, 32 instructions, and 0 function-calls
      (UNSIGNED-BYTE 16) 6 compares, 42 instructions, and 0 function-calls
       (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8) 7 compares, 52 instructions, and 0 function-calls
    NULL 5 compares, 31 instructions, and 0 function-calls
    (EQL T) 6 compares, 39 instructions, and 0 function-calls
    SINGLE-FLOAT 7 compares, 48 instructions, and 0 function-calls
    ARRAY 9 compares, 61 instructions, and 0 function-calls
     SIMPLE-ARRAY 10 compares, 72 instructions, and 0 function-calls
      (SIMPLE-ARRAY FIXNUM *) 14 compares, 91 instructions, and 0 function-calls
     VECTOR 11 compares, 81 instructions, and 0 function-calls
      SIMPLE-VECTOR 12 compares, 90 instructions, and 0 function-calls
      (SIMPLE-ARRAY (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8) (*)) 13 compares, 99 instructions, and 0 function-calls
      (SIMPLE-ARRAY SINGLE-FLOAT (*)) 14 compares, 108 instructions, and 0 function-calls
      (SIMPLE-ARRAY DOUBLE-FLOAT (*)) 15 compares, 117 instructions, and 0 function-calls
      (SIMPLE-ARRAY FIXNUM (*)) 16 compares, 126 instructions, and 0 function-calls
    NUMBER 11 compares, 74 instructions, and 0 function-calls
     COMPLEX 13 compares, 89 instructions, and 0 function-calls
      (COMPLEX DOUBLE-FLOAT) 14 compares, 98 instructions, and 0 function-calls
      (COMPLEX SINGLE-FLOAT) 15 compares, 107 instructions, and 0 function-calls
     REAL 17 compares, 104 instructions, and 0 function-calls
      RATIONAL 20 compares, 119 instructions, and 0 function-calls
       INTEGER 22 compares, 132 instructions, and 0 function-calls
        (UNSIGNED-BYTE 64) 31 compares, 155 instructions, and 0 function-calls
        BIGNUM 32 compares, 164 instructions, and 0 function-calls
       RATIO 22 compares, 138 instructions, and 0 function-calls
    STRUCTURE-OBJECT 14 compares, 88 instructions, and 0 function-calls
     ANOTHER 15 compares, 99 instructions, and 0 function-calls
     BLARG 16 compares, 110 instructions, and 0 function-calls
      INCLUDES-BLARG 17 compares, 121 instructions, and 0 function-calls
    STANDARD-OBJECT 15 compares, 94 instructions, and 1 function-calls
     STANDARD-CLASS 15 compares, 100 instructions, and 2 function-calls
    T 15 compares, 100 instructions, and 1 function-calls
     SATISFIES-SOMETHING 17 compares, 115 instructions, and 2 function-calls

So to read this you can say the code that would be generated by this
set of typecases would take 3 compares to determine that something was
a cons and dispatch to the relevant function, if it was not a cons,
then we need one more comparison to determine if it is a fixnum or
not, and if it was, then say 2 more to determine if the number is an
(unsigned-byte 16).  If we weren't a fixnum, then in the end to
determine if we are a standard-object (near the end) we would have
performed 15 total compares, 94 instructions and one function call.

So far I haven't put this information into use, but it's cool.
